This enables Nomadic Threads to take advantage of spatial locality found in the usage of many data structures, because the migration of a thread to a node makes access to surrounding data local. By reducing the number of messages and laking advantage of locality the Nomadic Threads approach allows programs to use fewer data transfers than conventional approaches while providing a simple runtime interface to compilers. The Nomadic Threads runtime system is currently implemented for the Thinking Machines Corp. Connection Machine 5 {(CM5)}, but is portable to other distributed memory systems, including networks of workstations},

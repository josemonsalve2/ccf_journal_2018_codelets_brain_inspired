Based on Codelet model, we proposed a novel brain-inspired computing simulation platform through the fine-grained multi-thread scheduling policy and asynchronous execution strategy, our platform provide a new path to solve the bottleneck facing the traditional parallel computing technology when they are applied to multi-core system.
We select LeNet-5, the most classic convolution neural network, as an example to demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of our platform. Compared to sequential execution, the maximum speed up reaches 23.8 times. Compared to OpenMP, the maximum speedup reaches 1.6 times. By combining DARTS with Tensorflow, we extend our platform to distributed computing system. Results shows that the fusion system performs better than single Tensorflow by 52.9%.
To further justify the superiority and scalability of our framework, we would like to test our framework on the larger neural networks, such as GoogleNet and ResNet. We may also deploy our framework on a real dataflow processor such as Intel CSA instead of simulating on the current von Neumann architecture and x86 CPU. In this way, we expect the dataflow program execution model can be better fit into the underlying hardware without introducing additional overhead, leading to better parallel acceleration.
